## Project

- [Entry of NSCSCC](https://github.com/Silverster98/bitmips2019)

    Nation Student Computer System Capability Challenge([NSCSCC](http://www.nscscc.org/)) is a competition requiring contestants to implement a computer system which includes hardware and software. In the third competition, we implemented a MIPS cpu and got 14 performance scores in the preliminary. But it is a pity that we didnâ€™t enter the finals.

- [BIT MIPS Experiments](https://github.com/bit-mips/bitmips_experiments_doc)

    This is a series of experiments about computer system. It aims at guiding beginner to implement a simple computer system which includes hardware and software. It beigns with some simple experiments such as implementation of full adder. Step by step, the difficulty will raise. Finally, you will implement a MIPS CPU on which softwares such as [ucore-OS](https://github.com/oscourse-tsinghua/ucore_os_lab) can run.
